## Work Experience
**Machine Learning Engineer (Remote) @ Green Advertisers OOH (_Dec 2019 - Jan 2022_)**
- Introduced Cutting-edge ML approaches to the company, simplifying complex processes and facilitating actionable insights, leading to successful deployment in production. Developed an ETL pipeline from physical data to SQL database, leveraging R for initial analysis.
- Utilized PowerBI to create dashboards to analyze weekly data and monitor its quality. Implemented algorithms to analyze large datasets, identifying key trends and driving profitability by $26K annually.
- Identified patterns and opportunities in procurement data, supporting strategic decision-making and reducing expenses and wastages by 10% within the second year
- Developed a regression predictive model with product engineering, achieving 95% accuracy in estimating client workflows. This resulted in a 30% reduction in raw materials quantities and a 15% increase in customer satisfaction ratings.
- Analyzed cash flow, income, and marketing strategies, leading to risk reduction within 2 quarters. Created a data-driven model (Regression) to estimate client workflows, enabling proactive preparation.

## Projects
### Potential Risk and Level of Hazard Classification (NLP/LLM) (_Toronto, Ontario_)
- Conducted Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of complex SQL database provided by Sofvie Inc. (Sponsor) to implement ML embedding techniques for accident prevention in the healthcare platform using Python.
- Initially, reversed Engineered SQL db and found relations between tables then with the help of join and subqueries using SQLAlchemy and Python to fetch data from multiple tables from Project sponsorsâ€™ data. Proposed genie project to sponsors.
- Preprocessing for accident descriptions and actions, Utilizing PowerBI to analyze trends and sites most prone to accidents and why.
- Developed models such as Gradient Boosting using different word embedding techniques like BOW, TF-IDF, and Glove and compared their performance using different metrics to suggest the level of risk for the situation and possible estimation of damage to surroundings.
- Improved F1 score of risk classification up to 20% by Implementing DistilBert and Bert using TrainerAPI (Hugginface) and later with Pytorch for a custom dataset.

### Australia Rain Forecast
[Project](https://github.com/Mxnxn/Rain_Forecasting_Australia)
- Utilized trend analysis, including VIF, to assess multi-collinearity and correlation of environmental factors.
- Addressed null values in certain features by removing them based on a percentage threshold and skewed and non-normally distributed variables by treating them using the median, treated categorical variables into dummy variables.
- Employed advanced classification techniques, achieving an 85% accuracy rate with significant F1 scores, 91 and 61 which was improved by 16% on forecasting.
- Utilized AUC/ROC, and F1 Score comparison charts to facilitate model comparison and interpretation to the audience.

### Plant Yield Prediction
- Liased sponsors on the project on climate factors impacting yield in 3 eastern American cities (e.g., Washington, Oregon, Idaho). Manipulate the data according to yield, climate, cities, and timeframe. Found production varies on each of them.
- Analyzed data spanning 1998-2022, plant processes identified outliers, and assessed COVID-19 and pollution influences.
- By incorporating pollution, NASA data, and COVID-19 as variables. Improved accuracy of Initial model (30-40%) with RMSE 900 and MSE 200 to accuracy (10-20%), RMSE and MSE to 136 and 91 respectively by using HF, HF + pressure features.
- Focused on specific locations and crops. Identified crops with potential yield increase and decline for next year.
